- Email checkin early next week
  - Things I’ve done
  - Update on todos
  - Update on reviving— re-assess approach?
  - Respond to Sayan’s ideas


==============
Todos:
- Look into the code
  - where does Exploratory mode fits
  - run it using Eclipse/Android Studio (see if it builds)
    - Android Studio is the official Android SDK platform so Eclipse not officially supported anymore
    - Device Bridge: may need a device for app to run?
    - Which Android API was originally used? latest is 25, maybe was 23
  - Running code with emulator as device (not attached via usb)

- Design of exploratory mode (fit into the current design)

- How to launch an emulator from java app
  - Launch emulator
  - Load current phone into emulator (may be easier with a third-party emulator?)
    - Mimicking user’s homescreen app setup
    - Installing new apps
    - Loading info (eg: contacts, alarms, etc)
    How to capture all this data and load into Emulator?

- Setup GitHub

- Check on Android phone
- Display issues (do we need anything specific)
